# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

* git clone repo <https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-z2f1l.git>
* Install Docker
* cd into Anythink-Market-z2f1l and docker-compose up
* The backend may fail the first time to start. Wait for all other processes to start and restart backend container. It's a timing thing that happens once.
* Open browser to here: <http://localhost:3001/register>
* Create user.
* Done.
